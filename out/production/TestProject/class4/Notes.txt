Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition,
    subtractions we can compare things if two entities are same or not, if a number is
    greater than the other number or not.

    There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational
    operators and logical operators.

Arithmetic operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations.
    Like additions, subtraction etc.
    + addition
    - subtraction
    / division
    * multiplication
    % modules

Relational operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities (entities). For example if
    something is bigger than other thing, or if two numbers are same or not, or if
    two boolean variables contain same vales or not.
    ==  used to check if two variables contain the same value or not
    !=  used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. we get a true if
        they are not same.
    >   used to check if one values is greater than other value or not. if greater
        we get a true.
    <   opposite of >. used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value
        on right side. if it's the case, we will get true.
    >=  if the values on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are
        same, we will get a true.
    <=  it opposite of >= and it used to check something is than or equal to other thing.

Conditional constructs
    Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that executes based on a condition.
    If condition is true java executes the code, otherwise it skips that code.

How to write IfElse conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code even another if condition

    if(){
    }

    }


Important Notes:
    1) For String we use equals method instead of == sign because it's a non-primitive data type.
    2) We can cmd+opt+l (Mac)  or  ctrl+alt+l(windows) to format our code.
    3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

    {} what's inside is called "block of code"

If else conditions:
When we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use if else if
When we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
