Constructor - block of code similar to a method that is executed when we create an Object.

Why do we need it? -
constructor initializes the object

How to create a constructor?
1. Constructor name MUST be same as a class
2. No return type

2. Parameterized

this keyword - used to refer to the CURRENT object

    this. used to refer to the CURRENT instance variables
    In situation when local variable have same name as instance -> we use this. to differentiate
