Methods in Java:
    Is just a Collection of Java statements and blocks of code like ef else loop printlns etc.

Why should we learn about methods:
    1) It allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them
    build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the comlete application.
    2) Methods allow us to reuse code.
    3) Methods allow us to be flexible.

How can we create methods:
    There are two types built-in and user defined.
Built in Methods?
    The methods which are designed by Java developers for example the println(), nextInt() in the Scanner class,
    length() present in String class.
User Defined Methods:
    They are methods that we write.
Methods which return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}
int             => return type of method
add             => name of the method
(int a, int b)  => parameters of the method or the input to the method
{               => body of the method
}

Rules:
1) return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
2) we can only assign methods to variables of same type

==============================================================================

There are three types of variable with respect to their scope local variables:

Local variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc.
    They are called local variables.
 Upside:
    Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always try to write
    code with the help of local variables.
 Downside:
    They can't be accessed outside the block in which they are created.

Instance variables:
    All the variables which are created inside a class outside of methods are called instance variables.
 Upside:
    we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is larger than local variables.
 Downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.

Static variables:
    All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are called static variables
