Exceptions:
    Exception is an unwanted behavior which occurs at run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly.

Exception handling:
    Exception Handling is a mechanism that allows us run time errors and helps us convert complex error
    messages to something simpler that a normal user can understand.

How do we implement exception handling in java:
    We have new keywords which allow us to handle exceptions in java
    Block of code 1) try 2) catch 3) finally
    Keywords 4) throw 5) throws

try block:
    in the try block we write the code which may throw an exception
catch block:
    contains the backup code, the code that we want to execute in case of failure. It can also contain
    code to simplify the error messages, it can also contain the code which might send a notification
    or an email to the developers or admins in case of failure.

how it works:
    We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block. Each handling a different error
    we can also put a last catch block Exception class so that if something goes wrong
    and there is no specific catch block to handle it The Exception one will handle it.

finally block:
    Finally block is always executed no matter what happens in the try block or the catch block.
    We should put cleanup code inside the finally blocks like closing a browser, closing the
    database, connection etc.
