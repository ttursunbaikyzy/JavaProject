Method Overloading:
    It's a mechanism in java that allows us to have the same method name with different parameters.
    Parameters can be different in number, type or sequence.

Why we should overload a method?
    Method overloading allows us to reuse same method name again and again that we don't have to
    come up with different method names if we are doing the same thing again and again.

How to overload a method:
    We can overload a method by redefining it with different parameters.

Method Overriding:
    It's a mechanism in java that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific
    implementation of a method.

Why we should override a method?
    If a child class does not like the implementation of the parent class it has the flexibility
    that iut can override that method.

Syntax of override?
    There must be a parent child relationship between two classes.

Rules:
    1) To override a method there must be parent child relationship between two classes.
    2) If something can't be inherited we can't override it.
       For example, private methods and constructors.
    3) Visibility of a method can be inceased for example if something has default access
    or protected access we can make it public, but we can't make it private.

    void name (parameters)  ->  header of method (includes return type)
    name (parameters)  ->  signature of method
    {}  ->  body of the method

When the method is static we say that we are re-declaring the method in the child class instead of overriding.
If it is not static is overriding, if it is static, re-declaring.
