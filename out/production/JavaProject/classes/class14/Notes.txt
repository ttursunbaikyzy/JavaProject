String class:
    String is the most widely used class in Java. It can store sequence of Characters. We should
    be using this class when we want to save memory, and we are not planning to make a lot of
    modifications to the  String values.

StringBuilder class:
    String builder is exactly the same as String class but is changeable(mutable)
