FileHandling:
    Reading and writing data to files is called fileHandling.

    1) To read or write the data first we need to know the path or location
    where we will be reading or writing that file.

    2) We need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so
    that javaprogram can process the data from that file.
    We use two classes to navigate: one is called FileInputStream and the other one
    is called FileOutputStream. When we have to read the data we use FileInputStream
    and when we have to write the data we use the FileOutputStream.

    3) We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data
    from that specific file for examples we use Properties class when we have to
    the data from the .properties file.
    We use XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from the Excel file.

Why should we learn about FileHandling?
    1) we will be storing data like username, passwords, URLs, type of browsers, etc.
    in configuration files.
    2) when we need to perform data driven testing we will be storing and reading all
    the data from files like xlsx or csv files.

How to read/write data from files:
    1) Get the path
    2) use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream to navigate.
    3) use a specialized class like Properties or XSSFWorkbook.

================================================================================================
what are Exception?
    Exceptions are runtime issues that can stop normal flow of our programs and can abruptly
    terminate the programs, which is very bad and leads to bad user experience.

Exception Handling:
    We stop the program from terminating abruptly, and we try to mitigate the issue we provide
    a backup code. and convert the error message to simple text.

**********************From Savo*******************************
Two main types of runtime errors:
   Exception
   Error

With the exception ending we will avoid this type of issues (The whole app crashing due to one
function not running properly).

If you think you are writing code that will have problems later on running properly, you can use ïƒ 
   try {
problematic line of code goes here
} catch (Exception e) {
   sout (e);
}

The issue will still occur, but the rest of the code will continue working.
Exceptions are issues that occur in the runtime, and they stop the app of working normally. The
mechanism to stop this is to use try blocks.
