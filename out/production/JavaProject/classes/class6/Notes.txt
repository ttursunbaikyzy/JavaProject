Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions. They only work with boolean (true, false) values.
    There are three logical operators: !, ||, &&

Why should we use Logical Operators:
    1) They can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have o write.

Not (!):
    it reverse the conditions. if something is true, it will make it false
    and if something is false, it will make it true.
    System.out.println(!true) = > false

Logical OR Operator (||):
    it can combine two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one condition is true.
    if all the conditions becomes false, it returns us a false.

Logical AND (&&):
    it can combine two or more conditions. it only returns true if all the conditions are true.
