Scanner class:
Helps use take the input from keyboard.
Logical Operators:
    Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
    There are 3 logical operators !  ||   &&

Why should we learn about the logical operators?
    we can greatly simplify the login if we use these operators

What is the syntax:
    they only work with boolean data type
    if(! condition)
    if(condition1 || condition2)
    if(condition1 && condition2)


NOT Operator (!)
    Not is used to negate the boolean values
    If something is true it will make it false
    If something is false, it will make it true

What is a SwitchCase statement:
    Switch case statement are just another of achieving the same results as if-else-if conditions.

Why should we learn about them:
    The reason we should use them is they are very fast.
Syntax:

String var:
    switch(var){
    case 1:
    sout"1"
    break;
    default:
    {otherwise}

    }

Rules that we should follow:
    1) We can only use byte short int char String
    2) We can't use the relational operators in switch case statements are also not allowed
    3) We can't use logical operators
