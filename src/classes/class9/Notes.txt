Nested loops:
    A for loop inside another for loop.

Important points:
    1) Read the questions carefully understanding the question is 50% problem solved.
    2) Always break down your problem into smaller steps. ALWAYS.
    3) Focus on those smaller parts test them well if they are working as per your expectations,
    once tested, move to the second part.
