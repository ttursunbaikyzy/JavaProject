Arrays in Java:
    Arrays allow us to store multiple values ina signle variable.
    We use indexes to get back the values.

Why we should learn Arrays:
    If we have to store a lot of values. It becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.

Syntax of Arrays:
    We can create arrays in two different ways.
1st way of creating arrays:
    Datatype [] arr={element 1, element 2, element 3};
    System.out.println(arr[0]);

2nd way of creating arrays:
    DataType[] arr=new Datatype[Size]
