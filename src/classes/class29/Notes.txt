Iterator:
Sets:
    They don't allow duplicate values.

    There are three main types of sets:

    HashSet:
        Upside: Fast
        Downside: Doesn't retain insertion order

    LinkedHashSet:
        Upside: Retains the insertion order
        Downside: slower than HashSet

    TreeSet
        Upside: it keeps the data sorted
        Downside: it's the slowest
