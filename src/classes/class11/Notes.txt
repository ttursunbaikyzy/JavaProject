2D Arrays:
    Ara arrays that contain 1D Arrays.

Why we should learn about 2D arrays.
    Because they allow us to store multiple one d arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
    for example if we have to store data from Excel files we can use 2D Arrays.

Syntax to create 2D Arrays:
First Way:
    DataType [][] nameOfArray= new DataType [SizeOfRows][];
Second Way:
    DataType [][] nameOfArray= {{data,data,data},{data,data,data}};

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is nothing but some set of rules that if we follow we achieve below.
    1) Code repetition is minimized
    2) Changing existing code and adding new features becomes easier.
    3) resenting real life entities becomes easier.
    4) Helps write secure code.
