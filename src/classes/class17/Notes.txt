Access modifiersL
    These modifiers control the accessibility of instance or static fields, methods and classes.
    There are four access levels and there are three access modifier keyword.
    1) private, 2) default, 3) protected, 4) public.

Constructors:
    Constructors help us create objects easily or initialize the instance fields of a class in a better way.

Rules:
    1) They are similar to methods, but they don't have return types.
    2) They have same name as class name.
    3) We can use all the access modifiers with the constructors.
    4) static keyword is not allowed with constructors.
