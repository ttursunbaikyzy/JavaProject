Sets:
    Sets don't allow duplicate values. There are three main types of sets: 1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3)TreeSet

    HashSet:
        Upside: Speed it's the fastest
        Downside: It does not maintain insertion order

    LinkedHashSet:
        Upside: maintains the insertion order
        Downside: slower than HashSet

    TreeSet
        Upside: keeps the data sorted
        Downside: it's slower than all.

Maps:
    Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets we have three main types of
    maps as well 1) HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap

    HashMap:
            Upside: Speed it's the fastest
            Downside: It does not maintain insertion order

    LinkedHashMap:
            Upside: maintains the insertion order
            Downside: slower than HashSet

    TreeMap
            Upside: keeps the data sorted based on the keys.
            Downside: it's slower than all.
